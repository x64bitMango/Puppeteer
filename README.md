# Puppeteer
Be able to mirror one of the many powers that teachers have over you, but now, you can use it on yourself! By using some grey magic, I've created a website where you can trick your web filter extension into blocking any site of your choosing!

> [!WARNING]
> Blocksi Puppeteer only works when system (Blocksi) administration have dynamic proxy page detection enabled and if they haven't manually blocked the blocking token being used. **If you have any issues, create a GitHub issue** with a screenshot of what your screen shows when you test it.

> For some school districts, if you spam puppeteer on a site like Google, and every google search becomes temporarily blocked, it might get flagged to the system (Blocksi) administration team as a spam of false positive requests; they might disable their dynamic proxy detection and filtering because of such to avoid false positives, leading back to the issue in the above text.
